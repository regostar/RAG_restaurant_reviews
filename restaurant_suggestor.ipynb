Unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries. Sweet was very different and scrumptious.\\nCorn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali.\\nDefinitely try this pure veg restaurant, when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes.\\nIt was deserted on the day we have been here, not sure of the reason for less crowd.

So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. üôÇ\\n\\nThe Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz. So full of the taste- actually well prepared. The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you‚Äôve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad. üòù\\n\\nNutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes: so good !

Service was decent as well.\\n\\nFood was outrageous, the order was chicken corn & manchow soups which were ok, Prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was Pan Fried noodles, if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu??\\n\\nVegetables - Baby corn, Brocolli appeared stale and they got a WIERD mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. I eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.\\n\\nStay away from Pan fried!!!!',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Great food. Esp the Know Suey. Starters were good as well. Service by the attendants was poor. Delayed orders after multiple follow ups. Great ambience. Mild music. Mild air conditioning. Very clean. Definitely try the fried prawns as part of the starters. Wasabi needs to be more like the real wasabi. They need to serve the sushi along with the wasabi and soy sauce provided in small bowls - the bowls we're missing. And you had to ask for the wasabi as well. Should be part of the table sauces, etc. Good to go there once in a while.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad! Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before? No not the hotel we\\'re talking about a function, well if you\\'ve been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu! And here at Hyderabadi Daawat, the restaurant, you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy! The hotel is very easy to locate! Its on the main road...while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you\\'re coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left! The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors, very calm and cozy place! They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions! And after the \"DASTAR\" was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA! Shorba is nothing but the soup! Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir...people in the North tend to have it more! And it is a very good source of protein! Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy! But the taste was fantastic! It was the best way to start off Your meal! Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken, Phuket fish, Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab! Let\\'s start with what we loved the most: The Sikandari Raan! ‚ù§ It\\'s one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep! You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren\\'t usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely! The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do...cause it just MELTS! And talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated! Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN! Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam! After winning one of the battles in 300 B.C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish! And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan! Well, we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan! A must must have for You all! Highly recommended dish if You\\'re here! üòç The next best starter was the Phuket fish! It\\'s a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce! The taste was of another level! Next we had the Wok tossed chicken! Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming! The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew! Soo we recommend the chef to look into that! And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab! It was the Barbeque styled chicken! Very nicely marinated and tender to eat! And the presentation was amazingly done! üëåüèª After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab! It was extremely well presented! Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs! The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour! After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar, Nihari Gosht, and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan! Nihari Gosht was Love! ‚ù§ it wasn\\'t like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis! It was different and very thick and spicy! And the mutton which they used was really tender! Do try this dish here! Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo! üòç Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places! Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice! And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs! You should definitely try this dish! ‚ù§ We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani? We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions! The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani! üòçüòç And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat...Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha! Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad! It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added! And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot! ‚ù§ Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it! And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person! He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile! Way to go Sir! üëåüèª',\n",

The Cafe in \"Driven Cafe\" is rather disappointing, staff isn\\'t very friendly, nor very observant to details. They ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains. I had Mocha and Coffee Crunch, both of which were average at its best and weren\\'t something that I would remember.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'This place is only a few months old. It\\'s true that Hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of Cafe\\'s, bars, food joints. The new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.\\nHyderabadi Daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.\\nIt excells in real flavours used in Hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.\\nStarting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. From the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. The signature mocktails and a must try outs are Mango Bloom, Soda Fountain and Strawberry Mojito.\\nComing to the starters, it\\'s the best to begin with some soup. Yakhni Shorba is the best try out soup.\\nPhucket fish, wok tossed chicken and Sholay Kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. Sikandari Raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. The presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.\\nHeading to the main course, Hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. This place has amazing Mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. The aroma is literally breathtaking. Chicken Tikka lababdar and Nihari Ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. The main \"main-course\" is Murg Massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. This dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. After a full on meal desserts are a must. Matka Firni and Double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.\\nThe staff here is very polite and friendly. The ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. The place has a huge space of sitting area. The indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.\\nOverall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing Lunch or Dinner. Most recommended!!!',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. \\n\\nBesides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.\\n\\nHighly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli. \\n\\nAmbiance - 4/5\\nService - 4/5\\nFood - 5/5\\nValue for money - 3/5',\n",

No other place in Hyderabad has Chinese food this good ( well at least till now )\\nLet me start of by complementing the service of this place- such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable, the owner Mr. Ali, who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet. The food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.\\nOur order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles saut√©ed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! The food was exceptionally good ! Each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan I've ever had ).\\nFood and service was mind blowing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wishes to have Chinese. And yes this place is going to become my second house, you'll see me here way too often from today\",\n",

While the Dark was awesome, the other two items disappointed me. The Salad had very raw cucumber and it gave me a bad stomach pain from which I'm still suffering. They also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken, cucumber, lettuce, capsicum and tomato. Giving plastic fork to substitute real cutlery is way more disappointing than anything in a place as reputed as TCR. The mint Mojito was a tad bit less disappointing. The syrups flavor dominated all the way till half the glass!\",\n",

At this moment there was a row of places for the mind to choose from, Urban Asia it was.\\nHonestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.\\nMain course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"All Star to the Food, Service and ambience... We were looking for a good banquet or Restaurant in Gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th Marriage anniversary. As the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends. Searched almost 5-6 locations but bottomed down to Pot Pourri. Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:\\n1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..\\n\\nThe starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..\\n\\n2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... \\n\\n3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... \\n\\nKudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS...\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'I ordered a Platinum combo today. I requested the chef to prepare it Jain. It included Chole Bhature, Sandwich, starter(Manchurian corn), a dessert ( malai sandwich),salad and a juice (Frooti). I must say taste was amazing especially Manchurian corn and mouth watering malai sandwich. Chole Bhature too tasted good.\\nThere are few restaurants in Gachibowli which are veg and out of them very few which prepares it Jain. Squeeze Veg is one of the finest veg restaurants which maintains its quality and service. Kudos to Chef Dinesh who customises the order on request. Keep up the good work!!',\n",

So did today. The food was delicious, almost every each item was tasteful, very few were on the average side. They have 3 main counters, one with asian food, one continental, and one with soup, salads and desserts. The have have live chat counter and they will cook pizza and pasta if you have a request. I think that the stars of the day were salami pineapple salad and the blueberry cheese cake.\\nAmbiance was peaceful and having the option of eating outside (al fresco - Italian) is always a plus. Service very good, staff was quick and helpful. All in all, a very good experience.\\nFood 4/5\\nAmbiance 4/5\\nService 5/5\\nValue 4/5',\n",

The outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures.\\n\\nWe started with Grilled fish that was Basa/Cod fillet skewered upon coals; it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney. The Paya shorba/soup was extremely spicy but very tasty.  Then we had Kottimira Chicken, Mutton Dalcha with Bagara Rice for the main course that came as a recommendation. Pachipulusu with the Bagara Rice also tasted awesome.

However, 2 days back when I ordered the food, it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there. I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess. People always say, avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all, but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order. So I guess never risking my stomach again. Going to miss that Maggie so much üò∑\",\n",

My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz. It's a poor version of our limca. The mojitos here are pretty refreshing though.\",\n",

But in this restaurant immediately when the order came I am really frustrated to see the quantity and quality. First talking about quantity it doesn't satisfy the hunger of atleast one person and then talking about quality it was not served hot . Readily packed food and looks like as it was not cooked fresh may be cooked atleast a day before I guess. I suggest my friends and colleagues never select this restaurant and I'll never order from this restaurant. I am even wondered how come this restaurant get 2.6 rating which is too high.

After that we ordered Dotsol Bibimbap which was a colorful food which would please your eyes and ofkorse your savory mouth and fill your stomach for sure (depends how much you eat :P I was full with one bowl) . One more dish that we had ordered was Ramyun Noodle which I felt almost like maggie with a very slight difference but it was soothing and filling.

Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration\\n2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.\\n3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.\\nDeserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.\\nTwo juices as welcome drinks were Ok.\\n\\nI gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.\\n\\nThey themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk againüòú\",\n",

It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!\\n\\nAmbiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.\\n\\nService was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.\\nThe price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!\\nFood 3.5/5\\nAmbiance 3/5\\nService 3.5/5\\nValue 3/5',\n",

We tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. We had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark.

But after taking money they didn't provide a table. My team stood there for almost 50mins. Later we were forced to walk out.

All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.\\n\\nCapuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.\\n\\nPretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!\",\n",

The service was although fast but the food was terrible. We ordered apollo fish which was not at all worth eating and the mushroom starter itself gave a unwilligness to eat. The main course we ordered was Murg and Veg Kolhapuri which absolutely had no salt in it. The restaurant couldnt even provide lemons to us even after requesting multiple times whereas they had cut lemons for finger bowl. A must ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to this place.',\n",

The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. Don‚Äôt know how they served it. So we ordered Boneless Murg, i guess it was Murg Musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.\\n\\nOverall one time try stop.',\n",

Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.',\n",

Considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the Veg and Non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the Roti's to come.\\n\\nThe manager PAVAN, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. He had just one answer Sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.\\n\\nOne Star that too just of the Ambiance and Roof Top.\",\n",

Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time. Well, what can I say, Mustang is much better-They offer everything in the menu. I never expected that I'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in HYD, but I really can't help it this time. Work this out asap.\",\n",

For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.\\n\\nWe had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.\\n\\nA very serene beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy a beautiful evening!',\n",

The buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. Veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. Budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while. We didn't have much appetite after the starters so that was good. Lots of little desserts - pastries looked better than they tasted, but kids enjoyed the ice cream cold stone. Overall experience was quite good for all of us - attentive service always goes a long way and we will be back.\",\n",
